# FizzBuzz

## It's a numbers game baby

The Fizzbuzz coding challenge was invented in 2007 by Imran Ghoryin in order to assess developer competence. Since its conception the Fizzbuzz challenge has been used by Facebook and Microsoft as interview tools and has also been taught at Stanford, Berkley, Caltech and countless other universities.

A few other features I implemented were: input validation (numbers between 0-5000), sweet alert error messages to alert the user if they did not input an upper limit to count to, and a sweet alert error message if you try to download an empty table in xlsx format. The clear button will remove all child elements from the table’s body. On “The Code” tab I use a Bootstrap accordion to hold my code for the project where you can see my syntax highlighted javascript code with the help of prismjs. Please also checkout my YouTube video explanation of the challenge and solution.
